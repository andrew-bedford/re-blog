# Writing to think
Whenever we gather information to answer a question that solves a problem, we become researchers. We may not always write down our answers and what we've learned, but we often rely on those who did. In addition to communicating, there are many reasons why one might decide to write. Here are some of the reasons why I write.

## Writing to remember
Solving non-trivial problems often requires lots of research, lots of reading and lots of time. The amount of information involved is often greater than what one can hold in their mind. When dealing with such an amount of information, having some kind of organization system becomes a necessity. This is one of the reasons that lead me to develop re/log, my knowledge management system. Everyone's system is different and changes over time, so I encourage you to try many of them, to take the elements that you like from here and there, and make it your own.

The importance of writing things down has become even moreso apparent to me as I became a father, and the months of sleep deprivation that comes with the job made me forgetful. I also like to think that my writing may help my daughter one day, long after I'm gone.

## Writing to orient ourselves and our research
Writing is not only useful to remember the things that we've learned, but also to track the things that we did. Reflecting on the things that we do can help us live a more intentful and purposeful life. Who am I? Who do I want to be? What makes me happy?

After all, we can't be true to ourselves if we don't know *what* we want, and more importantly *why*. If we start paying attention to things that resonate with us, things that spark our interest, then we can more easily define our goals and then take concrete steps towards them.

## Writing to understand
To write is to think. We do not only write to share our thoughts, but also to refine them before we do. There is a popular saying: *the best way to learn is to teach*. Writing simulates in some ways the act of teaching as it forces us to stop and think about how to best present what we want to communicate, which in turn can help us better understand things.

Writing also allows us to see larger patterns in what we read. For example, I've been reading lately on leadership and entrepreneurship. By examining all the snippets that resonated with me, I can better identify what kind of leader and entrepreneur I'd like to be. By summarizing and writing it down, I can use it as a goal. If I hadn't taken any notes, I don't think I could have defined it so clearly.

## Writing to test
Getting our thoughts out of our heads and onto paper (so to speak) can help us test and validate them. Some ideas may sound great in our heads, but don't hold up once we write them down. Testing them early on and often enough can help save time.

Like many skills, writing improves through practice and a willingness to accept and learn from criticism.
