# Learning from static analyzers
We tend to think of static analyzers as tools that can help us find bugs and improve the quality of our code in a cost efficient manner. And they are! But they are also much more than that, they are making us better developers by helping us understand *why* something is a problem and *what* we should do instead. Or at least, that's one of the things they should strive for. After all, if the whole idea of [shift-left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) is to identify and prevent issues as early as possible in the software development lifecycle, then arming developers with the knowledge required to avoid writing problematic code in the first place is the ultimate shift-left goal; you can't go more left than that.
