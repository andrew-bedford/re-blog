# To open source, or not to open source
That is the question that every software developer contemplating productizing one of their personal projects and starting their own company asks themselves. To be successful, a company must be profitable. It doesn't have to make a ton of money, but at least enough to cover our expenses.




## Crowdfunding
Open source projects may try to get donations through platforms such as [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/), [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/), [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/). It works for some, but most will be lucky to get more than a handful of donations. Unsurprisingly, it seems that people won't pay for something that they can get for free. Which makes sense, they need something in return: prioritized issues and support, early access to features, influence on the roadmap.

Open sourcing your product has multiple benefits:
 - It will help build a community around your software. They will help identify issues, maybe even solve some of them. You'll get feedback more quickly.
 - Transparency: Users can review the source code of the application before using it and validate that it does not do anything malicious. Most users won't, but if the community if healty

Once you go open source, you can't really go back.
